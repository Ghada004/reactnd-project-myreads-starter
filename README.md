# MyReads Project


In this application, the Home page displays a list of shelves, each of which contains a number of books.

There are  three shelves:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

The Home page also has a search button, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
When a book is on a bookshelf, it should have the same state on both the main application page and the search page.
The search page also has a link, which leads back to the main page.
When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library.

## How to open the App :

To get started the App:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
